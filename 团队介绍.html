             My motto is: People are great because of their dreams,
            and opportunities always belong to those who are prepared,
            act immediately and can persist to the end!

                Never compare luck with others.
                I never thought that I am luckier than others.
                I may have more perseverance than them. In the most difficult time, they can't stand it anymore.
                I can stand it for one second or two more. -Jack Ma
